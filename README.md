# Insurance_Charges_Prediction
In this project, Linear regression is used to predict the Insurance charges based on the dataset we have.

Project Description:
In this particular project, I'm using the insurance.csv dataset that contains information like age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges etc. and using that to predict insurance charges.
I am first pre-processing the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
In addition, trying various techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.
